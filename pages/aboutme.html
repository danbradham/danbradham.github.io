<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>I love to learn.</h2>
<p>The only thing I seem to do consistently is learn. My path may change drastically and frequently, but, I always feel like I'm growing. I'm driven partially by an obsession to solve problems, and partly to empower others.</p>
<h2>I write Python.</h2>
<p>For the past couple of years I have been fixated on writing code, mainly Python. I started writing Python after a short foray into MEL while attending the School of Visual Arts. I was mainly focused on producing artwork, when I found myself writing tools in MEL to help me and my classmates on our projects. Now I write code for a living!</p>
<h4>I also like pork a lot.</h4>
